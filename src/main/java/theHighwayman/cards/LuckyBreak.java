// "How come this card extends CustomCard and not DynamicCard like all the rest?"
// Skip this question until you start figuring out the AbstractDefaultCard/AbstractDynamicCard and just extend DynamicCard
// for your own ones like all the other cards.

// Well every card, at the end of the day, extends CustomCard.
// Abstract Default Card extends CustomCard and builds up on it, adding a second magic number. Your card can extend it and
// bam - you can have a second magic number in that card (Learn Java inheritance if you want to know how that works).
// Abstract Dynamic Card builds up on Abstract Default Card even more and makes it so that you don't need to add
// the NAME and the DESCRIPTION into your card - it'll get it automatically. Of course, this functionality could have easily
// Been added to the default card rather than creating a new Dynamic one, but was done so to deliberately to showcase custom cards/inheritance a bit more.
